# Snowflake Data Shares

Snowflake data shares give you access to the entirety of Flipside's on-chain databases in your own Snowflake environment.

This is the best option for teams that want to incorporate large amounts of historical data, near real-time data, or want to join Flipside's data with their own internal data, all without **** ever managing any nodes or complex data pipelines.

Access to Flipside's Snowflake data shares are free. Flipside covers the cost of the storage, and you only pay when you run a query (_via Snowflake compute costs_).&#x20;

### **Data Shares Available**

If it happens on-chain, we've got it. We have related off-chain data, too.

Data include core tables (blocks, events, transactions) for every chain, with added 'easy' tables (nfts, swaps, prices, etc.) and project-specific tables modeled by the Flipside community.

### How do I request a data share?

The **fastest** way to get your data share up and running is to:

* Login to your Snowflake account and request a share from our [Snowflake Marketplace listing](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listings/Flipside%20Crypto).
* Are you creating a new Snowflake account?  Choose the US East (N. Virginia) region 'us-east-1'.

You can also email your request to data-shares@flipsidecrypto.com with the subject Snowflake Data Share Request.  To expedite include your:

* Snowflake account identifier (found in your URL e.g. shown in bold here: https://**vna23581**.us-east-1.snowflakecomputing.com...)
* The name of your organization
* How you anticipate you'll use our data (_we like to know our users and we may be able to recommend specific resources/tables_)
